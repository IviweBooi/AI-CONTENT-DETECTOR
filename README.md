# AI-CONTENT-DETECTOR
A full-stack web application that detects AI-generated content in academic or written submissions. Users can upload documents (.pdf, .docx, .txt) or paste text for analysis. The system uses transformer-based models from Hugging Face to return an AI-likelihood score, highlight suspicious text, and provide a detailed downloadable report.
