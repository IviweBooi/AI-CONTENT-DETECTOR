This is a test file to verify that the frontend file upload functionality works correctly with the backend API.

The file should be uploaded to the backend, processed by our refactored file parser system, and the extracted content should appear in the frontend text field.

This demonstrates the successful integration between the React frontend and Flask backend using our new OOP file parsing architecture.
